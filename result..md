Okay, here's a short poem about agentic architecture, followed by a list of frameworks that could be used to build it:

**The Agentic Dream**

A dance of code, a thinking hive,
Where agents bloom and truly thrive.
No central mind, but purpose shared,
Solutions built, autonomously dared.

From data's depths, insights arise,
Each agent learns, adapts, and tries.
A structure born of shifting sand,
Intelligence across the land.

**Frameworks for Agentic Architecture:**

This is not an exhaustive list, but some popular frameworks and libraries that can be leveraged for agentic architecture:

*   **LangChain:** A popular framework for building applications powered by language models. Provides tools for chaining, prompting, memory, and agent creation.
*   **AutoGen:** From Microsoft, allows building conversations between multiple agents to complete tasks.
*   **Haystack:** Open-source framework for building search systems that incorporate NLP and LLMs. Can be used for knowledge retrieval and question answering within an agentic system.
*   **Semantic Kernel:** From Microsoft, enables building AI orchestrators for complex tasks. Allows combining traditional programming with LLMs and custom skills.
*   **MARLlib:** An open-source framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, useful if you are working on agentic systems that need to learn through interaction.
*   **TensorFlow Agents:** TF's framework for reinforcement learning (can be used in agent design).
*   **OpenAI's API:** While not a framework, the OpenAI API (including GPT models) provides the foundation for many intelligent agents. You can use this to build custom agents with specific capabilities.
*   **LlamaIndex:** LlamaIndex helps you connect custom data sources to large language models
*   **CrewAI:** Framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents

This list could also include other libraries and tools focusing on:

*   **Message Queues:** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for inter-agent communication.
*   **Vector Databases:** (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) for storing and retrieving agent knowledge.
*   **Workflow Management Systems:** (e.g., Airflow, Prefect) for orchestrating complex agent workflows.
*   **LLM orchestration tools:** (e.g., Promptflow, Chainlit) can make it easier to develop, test, and deploy agentic workflows.

The best choice of framework will depend on the specific requirements of your agentic architecture project.
